# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various clinical parameters. It's a binary classification task where the model learns from a labeled dataset to make predictions.

## 📋 Dataset

The dataset used is `Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv`, which contains patient data including age, sex, chest pain type, and other medical attributes.

## 🛠️ Process

1.  **Data Exploration:** Analyzed the data to understand feature distributions and correlations.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handled categorical and numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.
3.  **Model Training:** Implemented and trained machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
4.  **Evaluation:** Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
2.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
    ```
3.  Open and run the `HeartDiseasePrediction.ipynb` notebook.
